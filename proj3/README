This is part 2 of proj2, i.e. the server-side portion of the application.

Project #3 will add the following features:
AJAX to verify that the form to be submitted is not a duplicate.
A php script that reads the parameters from the form and stores them in your MySQL database on opatija.sdsu.edu. We will discuss database design and a sample DB schema will be provided.
You must also upload and store the runner's image on the server. Do not store the actual image in the MySQL database, store only the name and use a folder on the server for the image file.
A report that gives the roster of the runners, grouped by category (teen, adult, senior) and alphabetized by last name. The report should contain the following information:
Runner's last name, first name
The runner's image
Runner's age at the time the report is generated
Runner's experience level.
the report must be accessible only after a login.
A confirmation page

Roster Report - php part 2

Login Screen
The Roster Report must be password protected, and should be accessable at the following URL:
http://jadran.sdsu.edu/~jadrnxxx/proj3/report.php.
Accessing that URL should bring up a login screen that will have a single field, the password.
There are no individual users, hence only a password field.
You must NOT hard the passwords in your php code, but rather store them encrypted in a text file on the server.
If the user supplies an incorrect password then you should display an error message.
If the correct password is supplied, then the report should load.
